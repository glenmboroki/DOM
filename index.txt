// HTML DOM allows JavaScript to react to HTML events

// Examples of HTML events:

    //When a user clicks the mouse
    //When a web page has loaded
    //When an image has been loaded
    //When the mouse moves over an element
    //When an input field is changed
    //When an HTML form is submitted
    //When a user strokes a key
